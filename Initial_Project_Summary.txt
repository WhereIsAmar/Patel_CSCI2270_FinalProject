For my project I aim to create a system similar to Google Flights.
I feel that I use Google Flights so much and it would be very intriguing to create a system that mocks it.
I plan to use either a hash table or an unweighted graph that contains names of various airports. The program can be broken down into a few components. The first being attaining user input, in this process it will prompt a user for the time they want to fly or the city they want to visit. Dependent on that it will search the hash table or provide them with an outline for their itinerary based on the graph. Next, it has the ability to provide you with a random travel plan if that option is selected. Thus, the hash table or graph will have a random function that provides a random flight plan. I believe that this project has the ability to be implemented in industry because I had recently tried calling Denver International Airport one night for a random flight to anyone for the cheapest and they were unable to tell me. So, if I create some sort of text file that has all the outgoing flights for the night it can provide someone with that information which is really cool. I think that this project could present some initial challenges such as heading in many directions, however, if I can narrow down my focus on data structure I choose to go with I believe I will have a more efficient program design.
